# Sarah Hollingsworth Portfolio Page
This is a portfolio page demonstrating my experience, projects, as well as sharing my contact information and some information about who I am. This is intented to serve as a resource for future potential employers to review to determine my potential fit for an available role. 

The second intention of this project was build it by focusing on leveraging advanced css tools.
